# MERN Stack CRUD Application

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that demonstrates basic CRUD operations. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete records.

## Features

- Create a new record
- Read all records
- Update an existing record
- Delete a record

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-crud-app.git
   cd mern-crud-app
Install server dependencies:


cd server
npm install
Install client dependencies:


cd ../client
npm install
Configuration
Server Configuration:

Create a .env file in the server directory with the following content:

env
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db-name
Client Configuration:

You may need to adjust the API endpoint in your React application if necessary. Typically, it should be set to http://localhost:4000/api.
Running the Application
Start the MongoDB server:


mongod
Start the Express server:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
Start the React client:


cd ../client
npm start
The React application should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
